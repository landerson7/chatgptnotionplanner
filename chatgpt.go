				- 5 to 10 hours of work each week.
				- I also want one completely free day except on busy weeks where I may have one or more exams.

				Please create a nicely formatted daily schedule for every single day of the next week, incorporating my assignments and weekly obligations.  
				In the schedule, make sure to include a time to wake up at, I like to wake up at 9:30 am on days I have no obligations.
				Also include the time at which I will complete my obligations and an estimated end time.
				Do not forget to leave time for eating, as well as a 1 hour wind down routine at the end of each night.
				I typically like to go to bed between 1 and 2 am but don't forget to include my nightly routine.
				Make sure each daily task has a time started and ended associated with it in the format 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm.
				Make sure to include potential time driving and extra study time during the day.
				Assume it takes me 30 minutes to get ready and 20 minutes to drive to and from school.
				Please create a nicely formatted daily schedule for every single day of the next week, incorporating my assignments and weekly obligations. 
				Make the format such that:
				**Day of the week plus Date**
				-Task
				-Task
				replace task with each thing I have to do that day and the time.
				Also add a fun history fact at the end of each day as well as a daily motivating quote and daily protestant christian bible verse.
				Base your calendar off of the date September 2nd 2024 being a Monday as well and don't forget my quote, fact, and bible verse.`,
